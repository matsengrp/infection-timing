# Analysis functions and scripts

This directory contains scripts for conducting supplementary model checks:

* [This script](get_coverage.R) will compute the coverage of the infant-trained hierarchical model using the training data set
* [This script](poseterior_pred_check.R) will conduct a series of posterior predictive checks for the infant-trained hierarchical model 

Both of these scripts can only be run on pre-trained (and saved) models.
